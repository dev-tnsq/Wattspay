## Overview

WattsPay transforms everyday WhatsApp conversations into seamless cryptocurrency payment experiences. Built on the Aptos blockchain with Move smart contracts, WattsPay makes blockchain technology accessible to anyone with WhatsApp—without requiring technical knowledge, wallet management, or understanding of blockchain concepts.

**Core Value Proposition**: If you can send a message, you can use Aptos.

### The Problem We Solve

Billions of WhatsApp users cannot access blockchain technology because:

- Wallet applications are confusing and technical for non-crypto users
- Smart contract addresses are difficult to understand and use
- Acquiring cryptocurrency requires multiple steps, KYC verification, and technical knowledge
- Gas fees, refunds, and transaction management are complex for mainstream users
- The barrier to entry excludes the majority of potential blockchain users

### Our Solution

WattsPay hides all blockchain complexity behind natural WhatsApp conversations:

- **Natural Language Payments**: "Send 2 APT to John for dinner" executes an instant blockchain transfer
- **Phone Number Identity**: Use familiar phone numbers instead of cryptographic wallet addresses
- **Fiat Integration**: "Buy 1000 rupees worth of APT" triggers automatic fiat-to-crypto conversion via UPI or Stripe
- **Group Settlement**: "Split 50 APT dinner with Alice and Bob" automatically calculates and executes optimal group payments
- **Instant Refunds**: "Refund my last payment" reverses transactions through smart contract execution

WattsPay brings Aptos to 3 billion WhatsApp users, creating the world's largest potential decentralized financial network.

## Demo

### Peer-to-Peer Payment Example

Execute a simple payment transaction programmatically:

```javascript
// Initialize WattsPay service
const wattsPayService = new WattsPayService();

// Send payment using phone number
const payment = await wattsPayService.sendPaymentByPhone(
    senderAccount,
    "+1234567890",    // Recipient's phone number
    100000000,        // Amount in octas (1 APT = 100,000,000 octas)
    "Coffee payment"  // Transaction memo
);

console.log(`Payment successfully sent. Transaction hash: ${payment.hash}`);
console.log(`View on explorer: https://explorer.aptoslabs.com/txn/${payment.hash}`);
```

### Group Payment Workflow

Create and manage group expenses with automatic settlement:

```javascript
// Create a new payment group
const group = await wattsPayService.createGroup(
    adminAccount,
    "Weekend Trip Expenses",
    ["+1234567890", "+0987654321", "+1122334455"]
);

console.log(`Group created with ID: ${group.groupId}`);

// Add an expense to the group
await wattsPayService.addGroupExpense(
    adminAccount,
    group.groupId,
    120000000,  // 1.2 APT total expense
    "Hotel accommodation for three nights"
);

// Execute optimal settlement to minimize transactions
const settlement = await wattsPayService.executeOptimalSettlement(
    adminAccount,
    group.groupId
);

console.log(`Settlement complete. Transactions executed: ${settlement.transactionCount}`);
console.log(`Gas savings compared to individual payments: ${settlement.gasSavingsPercentage}%`);
```

### WhatsApp Conversation Examples

```
User: "Send 50 dollars to +1234567890 for dinner"
Bot: "Sending 50 USD worth of APT to John Doe..."
Bot: "Payment completed successfully. Transaction: 0x370360a1..."
Bot: "John will receive a notification shortly."

User: "Create group Weekend Trip with +1234567890 and +0987654321"
Bot: "Group 'Weekend Trip' created successfully."
Bot: "Members added: John Doe, Jane Smith"
Bot: "You can now add expenses using 'add expense [amount] [description]'"

User: "Buy 1000 rupees worth of APT"

## The Future: Aptos for Everyone

WattsPay is not just a payment tool—it represents a fundamental shift in how people interact with blockchain technology. By embedding Aptos into WhatsApp, the world's most popular messaging platform, we're creating the social payment layer that will onboard the next billion blockchain users.

**Our Vision:**

Traditional blockchain wallets and applications create barriers that exclude the majority of potential users. WattsPay removes these barriers by meeting users where they already are: in their everyday conversations. Every WhatsApp group becomes a potential entry point to Web3, every message a possible transaction, and every user a participant in the decentralized financial future.

**Why This Matters:**

The combination of Aptos's technical capabilities (sub-second finality, low fees, parallel execution) with WhatsApp's massive user base (3 billion users worldwide) creates an unprecedented opportunity for blockchain adoption. WattsPay is the bridge that makes this connection possible.

**Looking Forward:**

By 2027, we envision WattsPay powering millions of transactions daily, bringing the speed, security, and innovation of Aptos blockchain to billions of people who have never owned a cryptocurrency wallet. This is more than a product—it's the foundation for the world's largest decentralized financial network, accessible to anyone who can send a message.
