## üèóÔ∏è **Complete Smart Contract System Design**

### **1. Core Contract Modules**

#### **A. UserRegistry Contract**
```move
module wattspay::user_registry {

        wallet_address: address,
        whatsapp_number: String,

---

## üí∞ **Economic Model & Gas Optimization**

### **Gas Efficiency Strategies**
1. **Batch Transactions**: Group multiple operations in single transactions
2. **Event-Based Updates**: Use events for notifications instead of storage updates
3. **Lazy Settlement**: Only settle when needed, not on every transaction
4. **Compression**: Use efficient data structures and compression for large groups

### **Fee Structure**
```move
// Dynamic fee calculation based on transaction complexity
public fun calculate_transaction_fee(
    transaction_type: u8,
    amount: u64,
    participants: u64
): u64 {
    let base_fee = 1000; // 0.001 APT
    let complexity_fee = match transaction_type {
        SIMPLE_PAYMENT => 0,
        GROUP_EXPENSE => participants * 100,
        SETTLEMENT => participants * participants * 50,
        REFUND => 500,
        _ => 1000
    };
    base_fee + complexity_fee + (amount / 1000000) // 0.0001% of amount
}
```

---

## üîê **Security Architecture**

### **Multi-Layer Security**
1. **Smart Contract Security**
   - Formal verification of critical functions
   - Reentrancy protection
   - Access control patterns
   - Emergency pause mechanisms

2. **Multi-Signature Protection**
   - Required for large transactions
   - Group admin functions
   - Emergency operations
   - Treasury management

3. **Time-Based Security**
   - Transaction delays for large amounts
   - Refund windows
   - Dispute resolution timeframes
   - Emergency timeouts

### **Risk Mitigation**
```move
// Example security patterns
module wattspay::security {
    use aptos_framework::timestamp;
    
    struct SecurityConfig has key {
        max_transaction_amount: u64,
        daily_limit_per_user: u64,
        multisig_threshold_amount: u64,
        emergency_pause: bool,
        admin: address,
    }
    
    // Reentrancy protection
    struct ReentrancyGuard has key {
        locked: bool,
    }
    
    fun assert_not_locked(account: &signer) {
        let addr = signer::address_of(account);
        if (exists<ReentrancyGuard>(addr)) {
            let guard = borrow_global<ReentrancyGuard>(addr);
            assert!(!guard.locked, E_REENTRANCY_DETECTED);
        };
    }
    
    // Time-delayed execution for large transactions
    struct DelayedTransaction has key {
        transaction_id: u128,
        execute_after: u64,
        amount: u64,
        to: address,
    }
}
```
